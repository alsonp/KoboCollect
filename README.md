## Setting up your environment

This project depends upon the gradle-config and google-play-services projects

            |-- gradle-config

The `gradle-config` project should be checked out at the tag number declared at the 
top of the `collect/settings.gradle` file.

The `google-play-services` project should be pulled and at the tip.

Then, import the `collect/build.gradle` file into Android Studio.
